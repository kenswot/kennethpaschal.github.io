    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I help people and brands reach their goals by designig & building user-centric digital products and have interactive experiences.<br> Ability to translate business requirements into techical solutions. Strong in design and integration with proficiency in JavaScript,<br> Node Js, PostSql and React.</p>

              <br>
              <p>I am an ambitious problem solver with a passion for technology and who would love to join a team of like-minded developers to help grow and shape me into a senior developer. There are no shortages of developers in the world. However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless, developers with an ambition to learn. The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside out at the expense of having blinders. They are the ones who would admit when they are wrong. I may not be the most experienced developer that you will interview, but the one thing that i can guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his/her skills every day, play nicely with other developers, and is not so narrow minded in problem solving that he/she is not willing to try new novel ideas</p>
